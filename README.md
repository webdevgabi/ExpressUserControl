# UserControl
This application is the backend part of the "UserControl" project, where I create an API using Express and MongoDB, through which a user can be created, edited, updated, deleted, and accessed by calling it.

## How to use
The application is built in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) environment, so it must first be installed on your computer.

You should run `npm install`, which will download all the packages that needs for the application

Finally you can start the application: `nodemon main`

## What i used
- Express 4.19.2 ([official documentation](https://expressjs.com/))
- Nodemon 3.1.0 ([official documentation](https://nodemon.io/))
